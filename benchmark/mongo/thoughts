Mongo Differences that would be interesting to get a feeling for
* direction plays a role in relations
* filters might be using AF or find
* types might be embedded or not

Mongo Differences in Capabilities
* there are no query arguments on embedded types
* we do not have import available 
* we can only start querying from top level types
* not all directions are available for relations
